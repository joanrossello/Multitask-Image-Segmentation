# Multitask-Image-Segmentation
* Implement and evaluate simultaneous learning MTL U-Net based models for the target task of animal segmentation.
* Implement image segmentation models with classification and bounding boxes tasks, as well as image reconstruction.
* Implement a model that has multiple decoders for a single encoder.
* Work with a combined loss function that learns weights of the loss functions of each task, using homoscedastic uncertainties (noise parameters and regularisation).
* Use filter visualisation and feature maps to identify the networkâ€™s learning process to reproduce results.
* Assess results with metrics such as pixel accuracy, Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) score, and Dice Coefficients.
