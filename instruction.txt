this repo is consists of the following parts:
- models:
    include several network models 
- params:
    include trained result in csv format
- features:
    include several feature maps visualization plot 
- graphs:
    include plots for trained model result
and several python files using for training/testing

- base_task.py: for training baseline model experiment
- mtl_task.py: for training different multi task learning model experiment
- test.py: for testing experiment on testset
- plot_graph.py: for plotting result 
- loader.py: a custom dataset and data loader pipeline
- wv_mtl.py: for visualizing feature maps
- utils.py: include some helper function


To use the code:
For training: 
mtl_task.py main func contains an example of training our multi task learning model (segamentation + classification + boundingboxes)

some changes for running different experiment setup:
1. import the right model
2. config the right path for dataset
3. config the loss function, weights and task_order for training 
4. config the name of experiment 

For testing:
test.py main func contains an example of testing our multi task learning model (segamentation + classification + boundingboxes)

some changes for running different experiment setup:
1. import the right model
2. config the file_path for loading the model 
3. config the right path for dataset
